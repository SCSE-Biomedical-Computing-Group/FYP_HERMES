However, this could also reflect focal subdural hemorrhage along the tentorium cerebelli. No intraparenchymal or intraventricular foci of hemorrhage are identified.

There is marked effacement of the frontal and occipital horns of the right lateral ventricle, with near complete obliteration of the third ventricle (1.24) and mildly increased dilation of the fourth ventricle (1.79). There continues to be evolution of the intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid, and subdural hematomas.  There is a new focus of hyperdense hemorrhage measuring 13 mm x 11 mm in the right temporal lobe (2:3).

Subarachnoid hemorrhage remains similar in extent in comparison to prior study with blood seen in the sylvian fissure and at the suprasellar cistern. Additionally, bilateral hyperdense foci are visualized in the globus palladi (2:12) and may be representative of hemorrhages but stable.  There are no new foci of hemorrhage. While mild effacement of the frontoparietal sulci is again noted, the extent mass effect has decreased and there is now an improved leftward shift of the midline structures to 2 mm as opposed to 5 mm previously.  A left frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter is visualized with the tip unchanged in position in the third ventricle (0.73). Again noted is complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus with surrounding wall thickening suggestive of chronic sinusitis.  Previously noted lucency surrounding the left maxillary incisor consistent with erosion of this tube is not imaged on this study.",

The left collection is improved with some residual pneumocephaly. There has been continued evolution of the left middle cerebral and posterior cerebral infarcts.  On today's examination, the midline shift has progressed with subfalcine herniation and incipient uncal herniation with displacement of the midbrain to the right.  There is an increased size to the left ambient cistern.  As the sizes of the subdural collections have not changed and in fact are improved on the left, the midline shift is likely due to edema of the infarcted tissue. There is parenchymal hemorrhage in the superior temporal portion of the infarcted left-sided tissue which appears unchanged.  Subarachnoid blood products are again noted. There is a stable right occipital chronic infarct.  There is no change in the size of the lateral ventricles (47.7) or the third ventricle (1.55).
